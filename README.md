# Multiple Non-Profits and Health/Wellness

*Created: September 29, 2022*

*Last updated: November 4, 2022*

## Overview

For the COSC 499 Capstone Software Engineering project, we are working with Dr. Barb Marcolin alongside two other COSC 499 teams to create an online platform to track/calculate/visualize food waste. This platform is designed to be used by small businesses and non-profit organizations who need these calculations and visualizations to apply for government grants or simply want to keep track of how much food waste they've reduced. Users of this website will also be able to connect/network with other organizations to further reduce food waste by using each others' sources and services.

## The Team

This team (Group B) consists of four fourth-year Computer Science students from UBC Okanagan, each with an assigned role for the project.
