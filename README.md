# Multiple Non-Profits and Health/Wellness

*Created: September 29, 2022*

*Last updated: September 30, 2022*

## Overview

For the COSC 499 Capstone Software Engineering project, we are working with Dr. Barb Marcolin alongside two other COSC 499 teams to create an online, community platform. This platform is designed to be used by small businesses and non-profit organizations (i.e. Okanagan Rail Trail and Dr. Robert Petrella's Lifestyle Prevention Program) who otherwise would not have access to this technology due to insufficient funding.

## The Team

This team (Group B) consists of four fourth-year Computer Science students from UBC Okanagan, each with an assigned role for the project.
