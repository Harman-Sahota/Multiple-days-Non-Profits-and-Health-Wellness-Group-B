## Overview

Foodsaviour is a web application designed to minimize food waste by organizations by directing it to other sources rather than landfill. It also serves as an application with which organizations can utilize to generate data and visuals for annual reports as well as share their resources among other organizations. In addition, users of this online platform will be able to compare data, view it as a graphic and compare the different data gathered over time. The web app aims to do all this while maintaining safety of the data by performing user authentication and protecting the confidentiality of the data and that of the organization. 

## Features

The features presented for this user testing are as follows: 

- The user is able to register an account and log in with an existing account. 
- On the tracker page, the user can enter their data by selecting a food category, entering the total quantity in kgs or lbs, and the amount diverted to each source. The amounts are then auto-converted into percentages by the system. 
- Once the user saves the data on the tracker page, they are able to view their record in a data table which gives them the option to delete that record. The user is also able to see a pie chart generated from the data they have saved. 
- On the profile page, the user is able to view details about their account such as their name, email, and roles. They are able to edit their name and/or email and withdraw their consent. If the user withdraws their consent, they are prompted to download their data before withdrawing as their account would be deleted immediately after they confirm. 
- On the sharing page, the user is able to browse through posts, view only the sharing or only the receiving posts, search for posts by typing keywords in the search bar, create posts and sort posts using time filters. 
- On the sharing page, the user is also able to see a list of users they’ve shared food with and generate a graph to compare each other’s data.
- On the permissions page, the user is able to set permissions for access to each page as well as read/write permissions for each role.
- The user is also able to approve or decline accounts on the admin page and revert these selections. Once saved, these accounts appear in the appropriate table.
