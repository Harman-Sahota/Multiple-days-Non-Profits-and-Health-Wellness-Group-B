## Overview

Alongside Dr. Barbara Marcolin and two other groups from this course, we are designing and refining the online community platform, HEALTHENOW.com, that was created by Dr. Marcolin and her team before the pandemic. The purpose of this website is to allow small businesses and non-profit organizations to use this technology who otherwise would not have access to it due to insufficient funding.

The Okanagan Rail Trail is supported by Friends of the Okanagan Rail Trail (FORT), which is a non-profit organization that consists of local volunteers. They are the ones that organize activities and fundraisers and increase user experience on the trail. To support this group, the online platform we are creating will be used to host their wellness challenge, which is one of their annual fundraising events. In addition, this website will include information about the Okanagan Rail Trail to help promote and spread awareness of the efforts FORT has done to increase user trail experience, such as storyboards placed along the trail that tell the origins, history, and stories of the Okanagan Rail Trail.

In addition, this website will also allow health professionals such as doctors, nurses, and dieticians from Dr. Robert Petrella’s Lifestyle Prevention Program to oversee the progress and statistics of the wellness challenge participants to provide free consultations to Lake Country users.
