## To Do

###### Network / Sharing page

- [ ] Make a version that is open to logged in users and a version that is open to the public
- [ ] The 'network' page should be renamed into the 'sharing' page
- [ ] Grant users the ability to share items to a particular organization / person within an organization
- [ ] Should logged in users wish, they can decide to make their post visible to non-logged-in users (public)
- [ ] Everything non-logged-in users post should be visible to both logged-in and non-logged-in users
