# Client Meeting 18 January 2023

## Agenda

- Barbs would like to view our current system and streamline things

## To Do

## Research

## Minutes

- We will have a meeting with Wayne
  - Barbs will bring us in contact

## Decisions / To-Do

- Contact

- Barbs wants a column with types of users.
- There should be General, Admin or default, and Visitor
- Change 'admin' user to 'default'
- We shoudl not hard code in the 'admin' user.
  - Just add it in as a type of user.
- 'Category' should be first in the 'Inventory' table
- Make an option on the trackers page for 'Percentage' calculation
  - 'clients' in the 'Inventory' table should be renamed to ensure that it is a 'Percentage'
  - Make the necessary changes in the backend
- [Maysey] will make me understand the add 'new row' feature

## Questions

- Can we enforce a single service provider to limit the number of interfaces?
  - GitHub?
- Include both code contributions and non-code (team meetings, documentation, etc)?
- Can it be simple to setup and run, with no/little ongoing maintenance required?
