## Summary

- In summary, there are several tasks that need to be completed to improve a web application. These tasks include implementing a token for authentication and deciding whether it will be renewable or nonrenewable ensuring that the project timeline is met, communicating the token choice on the GitHub discussion board, and considering actions such as timeout and logout to protect user data. Additionally, there is a need to focus on the implementation of graphing, particularly using pie charts, and ensuring that the design is easy to interpret and includes percentages. Lastly, it is necessary to look into how data will be illustrated on the sharing page and implement any changes recommended by the TA to the discussion board.
