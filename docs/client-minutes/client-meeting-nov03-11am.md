  - Navigate to the [Indexes and Databases](https://resources.library.ubc.ca/)
  - Search 'abi proquest'
  - Check out good source results and retrieve useful information and statistics.

## Minutes

- There's always at least, a labour cost. Not everyone can be an employee.
- Have to ensure to build rich data to retain users.
- Have to help corporations find out how to minimize their waste.
- Don't dwell too much on the research articles.
- Managers will be approving budgets used for the year.
-

## Decisions

- Have to place something on the learning page such that the public can gain information.
- Decided by Gema -> We're going straight to Django pages, cutting out Figma.
- During registration
  - Collect email
  - Collect data use consent
  - Collect user roles
  - Different dashboard access for different user roles.
- We'll need a tracker page:
  - Enter the food types
  - Enter the waste types
  - Have calculations made
  - Have graph illustrations drawn
  - The metrics should include how much has been saved
    - If one has got 3000 pounds of lettuce, show how much is saved
  - Users will enter this data biannually.
- Another page containing:
  - People can use just their first name.
  - We will have a sharing / donation functionality.
    - 'Mark has this much to distribute'
  - We will also have a functionality where people can search for what they're looking for.
  - Page should describe locaation where people can do different things
    - Show where someone can send lettuce to compost
- On the admin page
  - Managers / CEOs should be able to grant approval to willing volunteers.
  - View the volunteer's calculations.
  - View the CEO's calculations.
  - Compare both CEO and volunteer calculations.
  - CEO and Volunteers must match with each other for this functionality to work.
    - Volunteer must indicate 'this is my manager'
    - CEO must indicate 'this is my volunteer'
- Users that don't consent to anything should be 'Thanked' and kicked out.
- Give users a picture of the effectiveness of their saving choices:
  - Conduct calculations that lead to relevant feedback and conclusions:
    - Oklin 24 hours grinding and drying solution gets 90% reduction, 10 tons food waste processed per year, but expensive at $23,000CDN landed Kelowna cost.

## Questions

###### Why can't we run the Virtual Machine and VPN simultaneously?

    - Barbara will review the Virtual Machine settings.
    - She can run them simultaneously.

###### How do we run code in the virtual machine?

    - Currently the programmer is sick.
    - He will setup local Virtual Machines for eachof us next week.
