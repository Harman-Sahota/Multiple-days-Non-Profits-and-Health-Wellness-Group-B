# Client Meeting Thursday 17 November 2022

## Follow-Ups from Last Week

- The websites designed so far.

## Agenda

- Discuss architecture (Django RESTful architectural framework)

## Minutes

- We could either have chosen ReactJS or Vanilla JavaScript.
- ReactJS will make things easier to maintain compared to VueJS.
- REST framework chosen to secure the transition of information between the backend and frontend.
- The calendar implementation is optional. It's not part of the MVP.
  - The community previously implemented for did not even know how to use it very well.
- Barbara haven't yet discovered how Port 8000 API will be configured.
- The user groups are still the same people as the Okanagan Trail project.
  - This project will help with the running of the foodbanks.

## Decisions

- The choice of the REST framework creates an incentive to have JavaScript on the frontend such as REACT.
- Will use Python3, MySQL.
- The targets examples for measures of produce food waste converters could be:

  - Food waste capture that starts with percentage of produce sent to clients, percentage of produce sent to animal feed, and percentage of food produce converted to fertilizer, which diverts produce waste from the landfill.
  - The target for faster time is as short as possible while balancing other measures.
  - The target for lean cost will be what can be raised and/or equipment donated.
  - The target for least disruptive is “smoothing” the operations as illustrated by a smooth supplier network diagram that minimizes produce waste in their networks.
  - The last target is the actual amount sent to the landfill.

- Priorities for Metrics:
  - Clients
  - Partner Networks
  - Animal Feeds
  - Compost Fertilizer
  - Landfill as last resort
  - Landfill should be minimised
  - Clients should be maximized
